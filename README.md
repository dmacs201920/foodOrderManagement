This  project(FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM) aims to fulfil the requirement of ordering of food.
In this project we used 3 '.c' files
admin.c
customer.c
main.c

In admin.c:Basically this file is about administration or rather simply details about employees 
Like how many employees are working in the hotel and if any new employee wanted to join then we have to add employee's details to file that contains all the employee details etc..
In the employee,s details we have
1.Name
2.ID
3.Date of birth
4.Year of joining
5.salary
6.Department

Basically if any employee wanted to join the hotel for work then these details should be filled compulsarily so that it will be easy and convenient to know how many employees are working and what's their salary, how many departments are there,how many employees are there in each department,when the employee's joined,what's employees ID number and etc.......

IN ADMIN.C:
The functions used are:
1.ADD RECORD
If any employee wanted to join then his/her record should be added to the employee's record list.

3.DELETE RECORD
If any employee wanted to leave the job then his record should get deleted from the employee's record list.
4.VIEW RECORD
To view all the employee's records working in the hotel
5.MODIFY RECORD
Suppose if the chairman of the hotel wanted to increase the emplopyees salary or he wanted to shift some employees into some other department then all the changes should come in the employeees record.to keep changing or modifying this function is needed.
6.ORDERS TODAY
This function keeps track of all the orders of the day and also helps the adminstators to keep track of transactions of each day and month and year respectively.
